# Section 1:

- C is a high-level language, when compiled, it becomes low-level assembly language.
- You have to manage memory yourself, you have to allocate and free memory.
- C is an imperative language, you tell the computer what to do. It's not a declarative or functional language. This means that you have to tell the computer how to do something, not what to do.
- C is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.
- C evolved from the B language. 
- C is hardware independent, which means that you can compile C code for different types of computers and operating systems.
- There's a lot of different versions of C, but the most popular one is the C89 standard. 89 stands for 1989, which is the year the standard was released.
- C is efficient, portable, flexible, and programmer oriented.
- Creating a C program: editing, compiling, linking, and executing.
- I'll write `.c` files which when compiled become `.obj` files, which when linked become `.exe` files.
- The `.exe` file is the executable file, which is the file that you can run on your computer.
- The `.obj` file is the object file, which is the file that contains the compiled code.
- The `.c` file is the source file, which is the file that you write your code in.
